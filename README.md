# Geyser-Project

# Smart Geyser with Compartment-Based Water Heating

## 🔥 Project Overview
This project introduces an innovative geyser design to improve **hot water availability** and **energy efficiency**.  
The main idea is to use **compartments inside the geyser** so that heated water is used first, while fresh cold water gets heated in other compartments.  
This avoids unnecessary mixing of hot and cold water, ensuring continuous hot water supply for users.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Prevent loss of heat due to mixing of hot and cold water.
- Provide a **continuous flow of hot water** even when multiple people use it one after another.
- Reduce **energy consumption** by optimizing the heating process.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Multiple compartments inside the geyser for staged heating.
- Intelligent **water flow management** system.
- **Energy-efficient heating cycle**.
- Potential for IoT-based control (temperature & water monitoring).

---

## 🛠 Technologies / Tools Used
- Hardware: Sensors, heating elements, control system.
- Software: Microcontroller / embedded system for compartment management.
- Simulation / Design tools: KiCad, MATLAB/Simulink (optional).

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- IoT integration with mobile app to control geyser remotely.
- AI-based prediction of hot water demand.
- Solar-powered heating system integration.
